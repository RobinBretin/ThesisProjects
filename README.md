This repository contains Unity projects and other thesis-related resources (e.g., demonstration videos).

# Repository Structure
## FormR_Questionnaire
Contains the Excel files used to create questionnaires for each study on FormR (https://formr.org), which were essential for data collection across studies.

## Study_1 (Communicative)
Contains the Unity project for the first study, which investigates how people’s proxemic behavior varies with different drone heights and prior framing (social vs. technical) in Virtual Reality. This study was published as a Late Breaking Work at CHI 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1145/3491101.3519750) and as a Full Paper in the International Journal of Social Robotics in 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-024-01111-7).

## Study_2 (Communicative)
Contains the Unity project for the second study, which explores people’s proxemic behavior in response to different digital facial expressions displayed by drones in Virtual Reality.

## Study_3 (Defensive)
Contains the Unity project for the third study, which examines people’s responses to a drone approaching at two different speeds, both in virtual and real environments. The results were published at the INTERACT 2023 Conference (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42283-6_29).

## Study_4 (Goal-Oriented)
Contains the Unity project for the fourth study, investigating how people’s proxemic behavior adapts based on task priorities, specifically when the drone carries either standard or hazardous objects.

## Study_5 (Arousal)
Contains the Unity project for the fifth study, which examines people’s proxemic preferences and performance with varying drone sound levels and cognitive workload.

## Videos 
Contains demonstration videos for some of the virtual environments.
